# 4.2.1 GET Foundation assets - IP

GUTS Tickets has agreed with the GET Foundation to transfer the all intellectual property rights relating to the ”genesis” version of the GET Protocol to the GET Foundation after the ICO has been completed successfully:   
  
GUTS Tickets will provide the GET Foundation with a perpetual, worldwide license to use and further develop the following the ”genesis” version of the GET API. The reason for partially transferring and partially licensing technology is primarily the following. Dutch law requires that such a transfer is done at arms’ length, meaning that the GET Foundation has to pay the fair market value for these assets.

Instead of opting for an immediate cash-out for the GET Foundation, the GET Foundation and GUTS Tickets have agreed to a licence for the GET API intellectual property, the GET Foundation being required to pay to a modest fee per ticket sold via the GET Protocol, this fee also doubles as variable purchase price for the IP being transferred. This fee will be passed on to the consumer and/or the event organizer. This means that fees are only to be paid if and to the extent tickets are sold via the GET Protocol.

We deem this fair given \(I\) the investment made by GUTS Tickets in creating and testing the ”genesis” version of the GET Protocol and \(II\) GUTS will become a customer of the GET Foundation and, accordingly, will be required to pay for using the GET Protocol \(as we will explain below, €0.50 per ticket sold at minimum\) and \(III\) the GET Foundation cannot distribute any profits.
