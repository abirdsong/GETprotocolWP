# 4.1 The road ahead

Rome wasn’t built in a day and the same can be said about the GET Protocol. Although development will be incremental, continuous and subject to environmental changes and factors. These factors include; local regulatory constraints, customer feedback and industry trends. Our vision of the four main phases in which the GET Protocol will be implemented can be described as follows:

## phase 0.

  
Token mutiny The GET Foundation further develops the GET Protocol which will be used and tested by launching customer GUTS Tickets on the Dutch Market primarily. The GET Protocol will allow for ticket sales on the primary and secondary market via the blockchain using GET.

## phase 1.

  
The token intifada \(2018\) GET becomes the only possible method of payment for the transactional and processing fees in the ticketing cycle. Furthermore, white listed third-party ticketing companies and event organizers worldwide will be able, through the GET Protocol API, to benefit from the GET Protocol for primary market sales. Every actor in the GET Protocol will have a smart wallet added to their uniquely verified identity, the actors, however will not have full control over the private key.

## phase 2.

  
The boston token party The fully accessible smart-wallet is added to the users’ account on the GET Protocol, allowing users to interact with their GET. Actors \(especially consumers\) are able to use GET to pay for drink and beverages tokens and other products before and during an event. End users and event organizers can choose to hold and use GET as a method to store the value of event tickets. As multiple stakeholders in the event ecosystem would hold and use GET, this would add liquidity to the ecosystem.

## phase 3.

  
Ticket liberation The full range of functionalities and full access will be given to all the actors within the GET Protocol. All aspects of the GET Protocol will be completely on-chain and the economics of the ecosystem as a whole will be self-sustaining. In this phase, GET is the sole store and transfer of value used for storing all event related value. All organizers can create events on the GET Protocol via the public and open sourced GET API.



## Roadmap Disclaimer 

We emphasize that this is our vision for the magnificent structure we would like to build. But by no means can we guarantee that the GET Protocol and GET will be developed or will have the functionalities as described above, in particular in relation to the later phases. What has been described so far in this white paper relates to how we perceive development of phase 1 and 2. The GET Foundation intends for the GET Protocol to enter into the last two phases. For these phases we expect that we might need regulatory clearance, because, for example, GET may qualify as electronic money. We will provide updates on a regular basis about the development of the GET Protocol to the stakeholders and the GET community.
