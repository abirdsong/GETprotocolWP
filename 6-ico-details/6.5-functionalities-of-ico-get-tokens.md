# 6.5 Functionalities of ICO GET Tokens

All GET have the same functionalities, however, only GET Tokens sent from addresses that are ”whitelisted” by the GET Foundation may interact with the GET Protocol. The GET Foundation will only ”whitelist” addresses that it has created itself for parties such as event organisers, ticketing companies and persons that purchase tickets via the GET Protocol. Such accounts will not accept transfers of GET from accounts that were not created by the GET Foundation. Accordingly, GET obtained as a result of the ICO cannot be transferred to such accounts \(wallets\) within the GET Protocol. An important reason for this policy are current regulatory uncertainties. In the future the Foundation intends to change this policy, meaning that, for example, GET obtained as a result of the ICO can be used to buy tickets.
