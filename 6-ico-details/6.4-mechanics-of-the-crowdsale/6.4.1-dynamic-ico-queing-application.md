# 6.4.1 Dynamic ICO queing application

To manage the contributions during the ICO, a custom version of the ticket queuing module will be utilized. This queuing application, which will be a customized version of our own tested and operational smart ticketing application, will serve every contributor with unique contribution instructions at a certain time. By using this application, we are able to showcase our tech while at the same preventing scammers from copying or mirroring our front-end in an attempt to lure contributors. This infrastructure will make sure the ICO will be fully controlled and most of all, safe for both GET, the GET Foundation and persons participating the ICO. 

_ICO contract publication & audit. _  
The contracts used during the ICO will be made public in the weeks preceding the ICO this will be accompanied with a bug-bounty campaign. GET protocol foundation will only use audited and tested contracts.



_UPDATE: Audit results Matthew Di Ferrante are in.
