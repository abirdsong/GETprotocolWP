# 6.4.2 Details on the GET presale

The ticketing industry is crowded and competitive. Although it is true that the ticketing applications of current ticketing companies create significant market inefficiencies, the companies providing these services have built relationships with EOs. These relationships and shared history will make it harder to convince EOs to make the switch to a blockchain-based solution. This means that apart from offering a superior product and having effective sales, competitive pricing is the most effective tool in convincing new clients. Thus, our current partners are able to exchange ETH into GET prior to the Public Exchange phase of the ICO, enabling them to use the protocol in the future against a discount thereby locking them in.

A portion of tokens allocated for the public crowdsale have been assigned to strategic partners of GET Foundation. These pre-exchange token contributors share long term goals with GUTS Tickets and in some cases, will only received these tokens if they have delivered on a certain ticketing volume.

The wallet address containing the funds raised during the strategic presale will be made public.

_Update 19 December - These 5 multi-sig addresses hold the majority of the raised crowdsale funds._
