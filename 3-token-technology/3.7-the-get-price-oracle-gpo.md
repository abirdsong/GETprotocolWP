# 3.7 The GET Price Oracle \(GPO\)

The function of the GPO will be to assess for the stability fund what a fair value for the GET is at the moment a EO needs GET to run an event. The oracle makes this price evaluation on the basis of data input of a set of curated exchanges that list GET. The price evaluation method and price/volume data input-stream the oracle uses in its price assessment will be made publicly available. The algorithm will include several random variables/components that will make it impossible for both traders, analysts and GET Protocol team members to perform ’unfair’ forms of arbitrage. An example of such a randomization present in the GPO is pulling from a uniform distribution between 6-10 days when deciding on the range of price data from a particular exchange to use in the price calculation. The function of the GPO is to set a GET pegging to FIAT\(efor simplicity\) for each event-cycle that converges/matches the price of GET on the exchanges market.
