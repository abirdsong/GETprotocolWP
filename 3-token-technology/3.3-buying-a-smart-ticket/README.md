# 3.3 Buying a smart ticket

When a user buys a ticket, there are several ways it can be used. Buying a ticket and entering the event is the commonly used route. A user buying a ticket and then selling it with the GET Protocol is an example of a more complex route. An even more complex route is a user who buys four tickets, sells one and uses the remaining three, etc. Different routes mean that users incur different costs. Depending on user behaviour, different costs are applicable. To define and express these cost routes, several abstractions are needed. These abstractions \(found on table 7 and 8 on page 20\) provide the protocol with a metric to allocate the costs and provides the user with insight into the costs incurred in a ticket route.
