# 3.3.1 Smarkt ticket buy-use cost path

A new user buys a ticket and uses it to enter the event; thus, the user does not resell the ticket with the GET Protocol. All the indicated price points are example data and act as an indicator at each point. The “type” column indicates what kind of cost is incurred at that step.

* ’Gas’ indicates a cost within the protocol that accounts for the gas costs needed to process the state   changes and contract instantiation on the ethereum blockchain. 
* ’FIAT’ indicates a cost segment of a protocol actor that in denominated \(and possibly settled\) in FIAT   currency. 
* ’GET’ indicates a cost that should be paid to the protocol by the event organizer to use the system for an   event. The ground level for this cost-segment is hard-coded at €0,50.

_\*The "GAS" price needed is dynamic over the runtime of an event/contract and can change, therefore a certain comfort margin shall be added for reliability._
