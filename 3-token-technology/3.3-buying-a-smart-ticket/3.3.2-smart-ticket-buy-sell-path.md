# 3.3.2 Smart ticket buy-sell path

When a new user\* buys a ticket and resells the ticket within the internal ticket market of the GET Protocol. All the displayed cost components are example data and should be interpreted as an indication of the costs a smart ticket encounters in the event ticket cycle. The only ’hard coded’ cost component for each event ticket is the protocol cost variable. This cost component will charge at the minimum €0.50.

## **Total cost per ticket route and residual**

_**  
**_Different ticket holder behaviours result in different costs for the stakeholders. The protocol should keep track of the costs incurred to present this data to the end user in a transparent way when assigning the minimal number of GET required for a user to interact with the protocol. Funds must be set aside by the protocol for the most costly route possible. If a user chooses a cheaper cost route, this results in a residual GET balance that stays on the user ’s wallet for future use. This means that the user will have to pay fewer transaction/processing costs to the GET Foundation the next time he or she uses the protocol. Apart from fairly distributing costs, this concept also allows GET to be distributed among a very large user base, which will stimulate community growth.

## Dynamic pricing with tokens 

  
GET will also be used by promoters, venues and event organizers as a tool to facilitate dynamic pricing to optimize attendance of events and reward customer loyalty. While the benefits and logic behind dynamic pricing go beyond the scope of this whitepaper the ability of GET to seamlessly and transparently issue value/utility to actors within the protocol is one of the reasons why a blockchain back-bone provides the ticketing sector so much room for improvement in both the efficiency of existing functions as well as the addition of totally new and innovative functions.

| Cost route | Total cost of the ticket route for GET Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A: New User - Buy ticket and attend event | €1,27 |
| B: Buy ticket and sell ticket | €1,44 |

_Table 9: Table displaying the total costs for a user. A and B indicate two different cost routes a user can follow when using the protocol. In this particular case, the Pbuy-sell route is more expensive than the Pbuy-use. This means that the residual Resuser for this user will be €0.17. Meaning that if the user buys and uses the ticket, he or she will have a wallet with €0.17 in GET after the event._
