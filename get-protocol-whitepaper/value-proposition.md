# Value Proposition

This white paper introduces the Guaranteed Entrance Token \(GET\): transparent and open smart-ticketing protocol for any event with regulated admission. The GET-Protocol provides primary actors in the event space the following benefits:

* Users: GET ensures that event participants enjoy a secure and stress-free ticketing experience, and   provides a simple and inexpensive way for ticket holders who cannot attend the event to securely sell   their tickets to other consumers/users. 
* Content-creators: The GET Protocol prohibits commercial ticket resellers from disturbing the value   chain; artists can be certain that their fans pay a fair price for a guaranteed, authentic ticket. 
* Event organizers: GET provides a scalable ticketing protocol to manage ticket sales for any size events   in a secure and controlled manner. GET controls and accounts for the true value and cost of transactions,   the ticket and possible margins/discounts. The blockchain ensures transparency in the true price and   properties of the tickets sold. This transparency by design aims to eliminate middlemen from the value   chain. The protocol increases market efficiency as a whole while increasing margins for the stakeholders   delivering actual value. 
* Venues: GET provides users with an honest and fraud-free experience that promotes a higher occupancy   rate of the venue. The token will also allow venues to offer dynamic pricing of their tickets and   thereby maximizing for attendance. As tickets are only used by actual attendees it allows for accurate   re-marketing \(on opt-in basis\) and giving discounts to their loyal and non-scalping customers of their   venue.

The GET Protocol and GET and how stakeholders will interact with them during the first two phases of development, is the subject of chapter 3. Chapter 4 contains a roadmap for the development of the GET Protocol. Chapter 5 will contain analysis of the competitive landscape.
