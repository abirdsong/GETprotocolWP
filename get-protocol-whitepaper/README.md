# Get Protocol Whitepaper

## Abstract.

Ticket fraud and exorbitant secondary ticket prices are age old phenomena that have had artists and their fans worried since the times of Dickens and Shakespeare. Thirty percent of all tickets are resold with mark-ups between 30% and 700%. The event ticket market is know to be non-transparent, inexplicable transaction costs added to tickets are a common practice among ticketing services. The solution is a blockchain based event ticketing protocol used by ticking and booking companies that will make exorbitant secondary market ticket prices and ticket fraud occurrences of the past. The protocol will offer these features while providing absolute transparency for all actors involved. These features are accomplished by introducing a smart-ticketing protocol built upon the Ethereum blockchain that will facilitate as a back-end backbone to the sale and trade of event tickets by issuing smart tickets to wallet addresses. The owner of such a smart ticket is free to **anonymously** sell a ticket but can only do so within the decentralized and issuance price restricting

Infrastructure/rule-structure of the GET Protocol. This ensures that ticket trades are done safely and within a set price margin. Over the counter trade or additional off-chain fee surcharges are not possible as trade is anonymous and the tickets QR code non-static. The smart tickets QR code is dynamic and will change as a factor over time and owner of the ticket. This makes trading/selling the QR code outside of the protocol impossible by default. The token, the GET, will act as the main stable value holding asset in the protocol in each event cycle. This characteristic is necessary for this honest ticketing platform, as the token FIAT value locking attribute adds both security and price stability to the protocol during each event-cycle. The GET Protocol will be further developed, owned and operation by the GET Foundation. GUTS Tickets is a blockchain based ticketing company from Amsterdam with an operational ticketing application/business that has initiated the GET Protocol and will also serve as launching customer of the protocol. Over the past year, GUTS Tickets has facilitated numerous events with its application and has much more lined up for the future\(330k tickets already **secured for** **2019** **alone**\). The token’s issuance, its utility function within the GET-protocol and the role for the token holder are all explained in detail in the body of this whitepaper.

The ticketing company GUTS is currently selling blockchain-registered tickets via its smart-ticketing application. In 2017 alone the company sold tickets for more than 46 events totalling more than 10.000 tickets. Where traditional ticketing companies provide a buyer with a static QR code, the GUTS application serves the user with a dynamic QR code that changes as a function over time and owner. One of the Netherlands most prominent theater companies, [Hekwerk Theaterproducties](https://hekwerk.nl), have partnered with GUTS and its team. [This deal](https://blog.guts.tickets/the-hekwerk-deal-7554071b26c1) alone secures protocol usage for more than 310.000 tickets in 2019. Several prominent artists and their management, for example [Guus Meeuwis](https://blog.guts.tickets/guts-tickets-modestus-partnership-76e2f42a136b) and [Martin Garrix](https://blog.guts.tickets/advisory-board-of-get-watse-de-jong-manager-martin-garrix-nyle-budimlic-cypher-group-32ec30ce06ae). Booker [Chris Payne](https://blog.guts.tickets/advisory-board-of-get-chris-payne-of-itb-266795e94804) of ITB\(repr. Adele, Maroon 5 etc.\) have also shown their support for our vision of a efficient and transparently merged primary and secondary ticketing market. With as main philosophy cutting out the profits made by parties adding little to no value in the event value chain. The protocol allows ticket owners to resell their ticket anonymously to other consumers directly in the web-application without the risk of being defrauded or getting scalping with fees/excessive margins.

_Table 2: The difference between GUTS Tickets and the GET Foundation_

The GET Protocol is operational. The GET Protocol is more than a white paper or a proof of concept. It is reality. GUTS Tickets is already selling smart tickets registered on the blockchain. After the crowdsale is completed other functionalities as reselling tickets within a price margin will be added to the protocols functionality.
