# 1.3.1 The Ethereum network

Ethereum is a decentralized database that is incorruptible by any central malicious actor. It can be accessed by anyone with an Internet connection and is very cheap to harness. These features render the blockchain as transparent by nature, such that many of the oversight and ticket verification issues are solved immediately. Blockchain technology provides an environment where consumers could locate a validated and trusted list of outlets selling tickets on the blockchain

## Smart contracts. 

  
The GET Protocol is composed entirely of smart contracts that allow for the creation and validation of events and tickets. The issuance and sale of tickets in primary and secondary ticket markets \(which can be controlled by event organizers\) and the distribution of ticket sale revenue and market/event fees between the stakeholders are both monitored and executed with these smart contracts. The protocol charges minimal fees for the use and creation of these contracts, thereby making the protocol competitive against the current off-chain solutions and ensuring maximal adoption.
