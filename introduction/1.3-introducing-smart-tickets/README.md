# 1.3 Introducing smart tickets

The inherent difference between the market value of tickets at the moment of initial sale and the moment the event sells out creates an arbitrage opportunity for both businesses and consumers that are hard to resist. Even for initially non-profit-seeking consumers, it is difficult to ignore the sudden price increase of a ticket. Data analysis of the “fair” secondary ticket market platform, TicketSwap, confirms this statement. The company reported that regular ticket holders who want to sell their ticket to other fans seem strongly inclined to add 20% mark-up for their ticket\*.

## Role of regulation. 

  
Even strict government regulation that specifically forbids ticket sales for profit in the secondary market does little to deter the practice itself. The rise of online markets has eroded the government’s power to regulate, even when the laws are in place. Modern ticketing companies mainly use barcodes or QR codes to store all of the ticket data required for event admission. These data types merely obfuscate a ticket holder’s information, which is later checked against a database prior to entry. Information is only encoded, not encrypted, and therefore can be scanned and decoded by anyone with a smart phone. These vulnerabilities provide opportunities for bad actors to modify these data structures and create a new barcode that will be unique but not recognized as legitimate when consumers try to use them to enter an event. 

## Nerds to the rescue. 

  
From both a technological and political perspective, regulating the sale of tickets by, for example, tracking the profit margins made on each ticket, is almost impossible. To eliminate the shortcomings inherent in modern tickets and ticket reselling, tickets should be able to “know” when ownership changes and the tickets themselves should dictate the price of the transfer. In other words, we need to make event tickets “smart” and store information in a robust and transparent database. 

Did somebody say smart tickets on blockchain?
