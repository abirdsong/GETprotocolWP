# 1.1 Non transparant and profitable market

The difference in demand and price between the moment a ticket goes on sale and the time that the event begins creates a lucrative arbitrage opportunity for middlemen resellers, whether they are individuals, bots, or companies. This arbitrage opportunity results in two distinct ticket markets: 

1. The primary ticket market.   
Event organizers or content creators \(i.e. artists\) issue original tickets on the primary market, at a price that they set themselves. Event organizers then engage ticketing companies to sell and distribute the tickets for the event, and the ticketing company typically charges transaction and administration costs in addition to the original ticket price. In some cases, these added costs are distributed between the event organizer and the ticketing company without the consumer knowing. 

2. The secondary ticket market.   
Thirty percent of all tickets are sold through the secondary market. The ticket resellers that belong to this market, such as touts and scalpers, acquire quantities of the original tickets with the intention of selling them at a much higher price. Ticket touts advertise ticket sales for upcoming events before the primary market even issues the tickets and, in some cases, touts make a deal with primary ticketing companies to acquire a certain number of original tickets before they are available for purchase by fans. 

Falsifying event tickets.   
The most objectionable type of secondary ticketing practice is fraud. The authenticity of a ticket is determined by ink printed onto a piece of paper or through an image in a PDF file, a ”technology” that makes committing ticket fraud as easy as taking a screen shot or operating a copier. 

## The secondary ticket market in numbers.

   
In 2009, Europe Economics undertook a study to gain a better understanding of the structure and scale of the secondary ticketing market. The studies findings:   
• For popular music festivals, 20-30% of tickets are resold at a mark-up of 30%   
• For high-end events \(e.g. Kings of Leon\), 20-40% of tickets are resold at a mark-up of 100-250   
• For very high-end events \(e.g. Madonna\), 60-70% of tickets are resold, often with a mark-up exceeding 500%.
